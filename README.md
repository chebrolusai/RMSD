The proposed Retail Management System Database (RMSD) addresses the complex needs of retail operations by providing a structured and centralized data management solution. The RMSD will streamline processes, reduce errors, and offer actionable insights into all levels of the retail operation, from point-of-sale transactions to inventory restocking and employee information.
